Version: 0.99.10
Author: Jordi Martorell Marugán
Maintainer: Jordi Martorell Marugán <jmartorellm@gmail.com>
Description: Identification of diferentially methylated regions (DMRs) in predefined regions
    (promoters, CpG islands...) from the human genome using Illumina's 450K or EPIC microarray data.
    Provides methods to rank CpG probes based on linear models and includes plotting functions.
Depends: R (>= 3.5), mCSEAdata, Homo.sapiens
